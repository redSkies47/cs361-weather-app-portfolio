#cs361-weather-app-portfolio

### About
This is a quarter-long project for the class CS 361 Software Engineering I. Following an Agile workflow, there were 4 Sprints that culminated with a finished project. Each sprint required the addition of features to the app. The majority of the project was my sole responsibility. However, notable with this project is the need for collaboration with a peer Jonathan Saks by using his [Temperature Converter microservice](https://github.com/thatsaksyguy/CS361-FtoC_Microservice). This entails building and implementing a custom API for connecting with the microservice.

### Project Presentation
The following is my class presentation that showcases the webapp in action and goes over the code in the last half.
